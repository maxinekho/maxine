    <h2><strong>Observations</strong></h2>
    If there is one thing that I <p class="highlight-open-table">dread </p>about dining out with friends or colleagues, it would be <p class="highlight-open-table">the amount of time and effort spent taking care of the latter part of the dining experience‚Äì</p>requesting for the check during peak hours, devising a plan for splitting the total bill, and enduring the back-and-forth with the staff about payment policies and processing restrictions, to mention a few.<br><br>
  Do New Yorkers get a similar feeling of dread for this reason?<br><br>

    <h2><strong>User Research</strong></h2>
    With the <p class="highlight-open-table">time constraint</p>, I conducted a remote survey to learn more about the collective dining experiences of 10 people ages 18‚Äì24 currently living in New York.<br>
    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/survey.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="I conducted a survey about dining out in New York via Google Forms"><br>

  <h5><strong>1. Dining-out Frequency</strong></h5>
  The sample comprises <p class="highlight-open-table">frequent diners‚Äì with 90% of the pool eating 2 to 5 times a week, on average.</p>

    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/frequency.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="A chart showing sample's dining frequency">

    <p class="highlight-open-table">9 out of 10</p> frequently dine out with friends or colleagues.
    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/frequency-2.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="A chart showing how often the sample dines out with friends or colleagues">
    <h3 class="image-caption"><em>NOTE 5 for Frequently and 1 for Rarely</em></h3><br><br>

    <h5><strong>2. Preferred Payment Method</strong></h5>
    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/payment.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="A chart showing how the sample prefers to to split the check">
    ‚Ä¢  <p class="highlight-open-table"> 7 out of 10 prefer splitting the total check according to individual and/or shared orders.</p> 1 of the 7 selected ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt split the check. It‚Äôs my or someone else‚Äôs treat!‚Äù<br><br>

    ‚Ä¢  <p class="highlight-open-table">2 out of 10 prefer splitting the total check evenly.</p><br><br>

    ‚Ä¢  1 of them described how <em>‚ÄúOne person puts down a single card to make it easy for the waiter. Then we Venmo each other for our portions later.‚Äù</em><br><br>

  Additionally, all of them <p class="highlight-open-table">prefer credit/debit cards to cash as method of payment.</p><br><br>

    <h5><strong>3. Making Reservations</strong></h5>
    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/reserve.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="A chart showing how the sample makes table reservations">
    <p class="highlight-open-table">Overall, OpenTable was the most popular booking tool</p> (Other choices: Resy, Yelp, making phone calls, through restaurant‚Äôs website, physically inquiring)<br><br>

    <h5><strong>4. "How can your dining experience be improved?‚Äù</strong></h5>
    <em>‚ÄúSettling payments to the restaurant <p class="highlight-open-table"> through an application‚Äù</p><br><br>

    <p class="highlight-open-table">‚ÄúAutomatic bill-splitting‚Äù</p><br><br>

    ‚ÄúHaving machines/iPads for menus so <p class="highlight-open-table">ordering process can be streamlined & staff interaction will be lessened‚Äù</p><br><br>

    ‚ÄúMore <p class="highlight-open-table">automation</p>, less waiting‚Äù<br><br>

    ‚ÄúI wish restaurants had <p class="highlight-open-table">POS systems</p> that rang in orders by person instead of by table and then could easily print and <p class="highlight-open-table">charge on a per person basis instead of splitting up an itemized bill by hand</p> because I know that is time consuming/hard for server.‚Äù<br><br>

        ‚Äú<p class="highlight-open-table">If the check can be separated from the beginning instead</p>, so we don‚Äôt have to try to tell the waiter who got what and so forth.‚Äù</em><br><br><br>



  <h2><strong>User and User Goals</strong></h2>
  <h5 class="highlight-open-table">A student or young professional</h5> wants to:<br><br>
  ‚Ä¢ know the current capacity of a restaurant<br>
  ‚Ä¢ book a reservation and invite his/her friends<br>
  ‚Ä¢ select items from the menu<br>
  ‚Ä¢ split the total bill‚Äì <h5 class="highlight-open-table">all through a single app!</h5><br><br><br>


  <h2><strong>User Journey Maps</strong></h2>

  <h2><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2>
  ‚Ä¢ Most diners access booking tools and coordinate plans on their <p class="highlight-open-table">mobile devices.</p><br><br>
  ‚Ä¢ Users become <p class="highlight-open-table">anxious</p> when dining in a group especially if they have a tight budget or are avoiding an overdraft.<br><br>
  ‚Ä¢ Not all bill splitting methods (split evenly, per individual and shared orders, etc) can be done by the establishments.<br><br>
  ‚Ä¢ The <p class="highlight-open-table">disconnect between the staff and diners</p>, especially in notifying diners of acceptable payment and splitting methods and the act of bill splitting itself, <p class="highlight-open-table">ruins the dining experience for many.</p><br><br><br><br>


  <h2><strong><em>How might we streamline the social smart-dining experience?</em></strong></h2>

    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/flowchart_v2.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Mapping out the ideal overall dining experience with the app">
  Upon laying out the user experience flow, I noticed that high-level features (such as making a reservation, discover/search, confirming attendance, payments, etc) have already been implemented and nearly perfected by apps‚Äì mainly by OpenTable.
  <br><br>

  This <p class="highlight-open-table">marked up version</p> identifies components already made available in the OpenTable mobile app:

    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/ot_flowchart_v2.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Red dots mark the steps already made available in the OpenTable mobile app">

    <h2><strong>Rethinking My Approach</strong></h2>
    <h5>My initial plan of designing and building a booking app from scratch no longer seemed feasible.</h5>

    1. Many diners already use OpenTable. The <p class="highlight-open-table">high effort and time-based switching costs</p> will discourage users from switching to a new booking tool.<br><br>

    2. Another option would be to create an app purely for custom bill splitting; however, the <p class="highlight-open-table">back and forth between booking apps and services</p> is tedious and <p class="highlight-open-table">counterintuitive</p>. This creates a disjointed experience.<br><br>

  Since a large pool of millennial diners in New York are already on OpenTable, I chose to <p class="highlight-open-table">redesign</p> the existing experience to accommodate (1) a walk-in option (and access to waitlist) via geolocation, (2) an interactive in-app menu, and (3) an option for customized bill splitting.<br><br>

  <h2><strong>OpenTable Tab</strong></h2>

  During my trip to LA, I found out about OpenTable‚Äôs Tab, an in-app feature that eliminates the back-and-forth of cash or credit cards between the staff and the diner/s.

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/app.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="OpenTable's Tab feature">

  Although Tab offers the convenience of paying through phone, <p class="highlight-open-table">it still does not enable bill splitting.</p> For this reason, I pursued designing the bill splitting feature for Tab.<br><br>

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/web-app.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Only two restaurants on OpenTable Tab in the whole of New York.">

  Tab was piloted in June 2016, but <p class="highlight-open-table">there are only two restaurants in New York that are actually on OpenTable Tab</p>‚Äì Big Daddy‚Äôs and Duke‚Äôs.<br><br>

  It‚Äôs been almost two years since the Priceline Group (PCLN) piloted OpenTable Tab. This made me question‚Äì<br>

  <h5><em>Why there aren‚Äôt more restaurants utilizing Tab for rapid turnover, increased security and trust, and a decrease in customer complaints that emerge from traditional payment processes?</em></h5>

  I looked to OpenTable‚Äôs interface to find the reason/s for Tab's low market penetration.<br><br><br>

    <h2><strong>Sketching New Touchpoints</strong></h2>

    <h3 class="image-caption"><em>All sketches and designs are based on the OpenTable app‚Äôs version (Ver.11.11.0) as of March 1, 2018.</em></h3><br><br>

  I started sketching screens from the splash page and through the check-in touchpoint. Linking existing screens with new ‚Äúsolution screens‚Äù helped me explore the feasibility and efficiency of the solutions envisioned.<br><br>

    <h5>Touchpoint A: <strong>Walk-In Feature</strong></h5>

    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/checkin flow.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Anticipated user flow with a broad overview of proposed touchpoint solutions">

    <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/order_flow.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Anticipated user flow with a broad overview of proposed touchpoint solutions">

    <h5>Touchpoint C: <strong>Providing Bill Splitting Options</strong></h5>

  <h2><strong>Prototype: Walk-In Flow</strong></h2>

  <iframe width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/CTPSJVBEB9H" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br><br>

  <h2><strong>User Testing</strong></h2>
  I sat down with OpenTable users to test out the usability of my designs. I asked them to interact with the walk in flow prototype as I gave general instructions. I took notes of mistaken clicks, expected (and missed) interactions, reactions, and questions:

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-opentable/user_testing.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="I took note of the users' comments and frustrations and organized them as cards under their respective screen."><br><br>

  <h2><strong>Next Iterations</strong></h2>
  I identified the problems and thought through ways I could eliminate the confusion and distress from the experience.

  <h2><strong>Prototype: Reservation Flow</strong></h2>

  <iframe width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/U9PSJW4W5QN" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><br><br>

  <h2><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>
  While iterating through designs, some ideas came to mind. I would have explored or studied if I had more time to work on this project. <br><br>
  <strong>1. Monitor the payment statuses of your co-diners in real time</strong><br>
  This feature would automatically be on display as soon as an individual has settled his/her portion of the check. He/she will be able to tell whether everyone has already completed their portions, and if not, see whose payments are still ‚Äúin progress.‚Äù<br><br>
  <strong>2. Leave a review for the restaurant</strong><br>
  While waiting for the rest of the diners to complete their payments, the diner will be prompted to leave a review or rate his/her experience at the establishment.<br><br>
  <strong>3. Short walk-through guide upon opening a Tab</strong><br>
  A short walkthrough of the ordering and payment process through OpenTable Tab will be extremely useful to new users. I imagine that this will help them ease into the automated dining process that OpenTable Tab makes available to them.<br><br>

  <h2><strong>Result</strong></h2>
  If OpenTable were to ship this redesign with added features, I hope that in-app payments impact the way restaurateurs run their businesses and allow them to focus on enhancing the overall dining experience for their diners.

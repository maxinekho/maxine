  <h2><strong>My Design Process</strong></h2>
  <h5><strong>1. Understand and ask questions</strong></h5>
  The product owner and my project manager briefed me about the NYU Tandon Summer Research Program, the hiring        process that is currently in place, and primary audiences involved:<br>
  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/primary-audience.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Primary stakeholders for this project">
  Then they walked me through the legacy system‚Ä¶<br>
  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/legacy.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="The legacy hiring process for the NYU Tandon Summer Research Program">
  <strong>Problem</strong><br>
  In current process, administrators <p class="highlight-janus">transfer and duplicate data across a range of applications.</p> They <p class="highlight-janus">spend five months</p> organizing information and onboarding hired applicants for a 10-week research program.<br><br>

  Time and effort that could have been directed towards student engagement and professional growth is spent instead <p class="highlight-janus">carrying out manual administrative processes.</p> Additionally, <p class="highlight-janus">opportunities are lost</p> when students miss deadlines or are rejected due to incomplete documents as a result of the <p class="janus-highlight">disjointed process.</p><br><br>

  <strong>User Goals</strong><br>
  <ul>
      <li>To eliminate as much manual labor (inputting, compiling, storing, and viewing data) possible</li>
      <li>To provide opportunities for data mining</li>
      <li>To minimize manual labor, paper and energy waste</li>
      <li>To introduce a simple yet efficient hiring process that encourages maximum engagement and participation from both SRP faculty and students</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><em>"How might we close experience gaps in the current SRP hiring process?"</em></h2><br>
  <h5><strong>2. Reeaeally understand</strong></h5>

  There are many ways go about designing a product that addresses these problems. However, in order to deliver the solution‚Äìone that does not only hit all the goals identified but also maximizes opportunities (for the three user groups)‚Äì I needed to ‚Äòdigest‚Äô the current workflow and all possible use cases.<br><br>
          Being an avid (and slightly obsessive) notetaker, I made color-coded diagrams!<br><br>
  The workflow‚Äôs complexities became more digestible to me as I grouped action points together according to the ‚Äòuser in action‚Äô (SRP Admin, Faculty, or Student).<br>
   <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/user-flows.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Janus user flows highlighting each stakeholder">
    I spent time understanding all the interactions necessary for one complete cycle (a.k.a. successfully hiring one student)<br><br>
  The interaction illustrated by the back and forth and crossing over of actions in my diagram led to an insight that informed my design decisions:<br><br>

  <h2>The SRP workflow is highly procedural and response-driven.</h2><br>
  Being a newbie in the team, I approached my project manager to confirm my impressions.<br><br>
  Looking at the diagram I put together, we carefully identified which steps to adopt, automate, or omit from the current hiring process.<br><br>

  <h5><strong>3. Set up process expectations for the system</strong></h5>

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/system-design.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Setting system design expectations">

  Instead of taking on all three users‚Äô ends simultaneously, I decided to delve deeper into the faculty side first. Faculty mentors provide the first input between the faculty and student interaction.<br><br>

  <strong>Key Findings (Faculty)</strong><br><br>
  1. Faculty mentors typically manage three or fewer research projects each summer.<br><br>
  2. Faculty mentors find some value in the disjointedness of the current hiring process in that they are not overwhelmed by a wave of tasks and deadlines‚Äì tasks tend to come in timely email reminders from the admin.<br><br>
  3. Faculty mentors value accessibility and ease of use. They do not expect the application to have a steep learning curve.<br><br>

  After defining the workflows, constraints, and expected functions for each stakeholder, it was time to dip my toes in the water.<br><br>

  <em>"Do I start with the dashboard? Page navigation?"</em><br><br>

  With the overwhelming amount of liberty I had at this stage, I decided to start with one core feature‚Äì <p class="highlight-janus">the application form.</p> I reviewed last summer‚Äôs project list to gain more insight on the pieces of information and the level of specificity required for a project posting.<br>

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/about.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Janus application form for faculty members who want to endorse their research projects for posting">

  From here, I asked questions like:<br><br>

  <em>‚ÄúHow can a mentor access each application form?‚Ä¶be notified of a successful posting?‚Äù</em><br><br>
  This brought me to design the <p class="highlight-janus">dashboard.</p><br>

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/dashboard-within.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="Faculty view of the Janus dashboard">

  To expand the scope of my design, I diagrammed use cases ranging from the simple to complex situations that faculty mentors would most likely experience in their hiring journeys.<br><br>

  In doing so, I was able to better identify the expected functionality and features of Janus.<br><br>

  <h3 class="image-caption">Six use cases for the faculty end</h3><br><br>

  <h5><strong>5. Create designs that nudge decision-making and behavior</strong></h5>
  ‚ÄúThe SRP workflow is highly procedural and response-driven.‚Äù<br><br>

  <h2><em>"How can each stakeholder best accomplish his/her tasks?"</em></h2><br><br>

  The checklist format for completing steps in the process provides the user with <p class="highlight-janus"><strong>contextual guidance</strong></p> at any given time.<br>

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/progress.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="The checklist format provides users with contextual guidance.">
  In addition to this, the task-focused user interface is infused with <p class="highlight-janus"><strong>progress indicators</strong></p>‚Ä¶<br>

  <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/form.png") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="The progress indicator guides the user as he/she accomplishes tasks">
  ‚Ä¶and even for tracking higher-level interactions with other users in the system. These features allow users to have a sense of control over a complex, response-driven workflow.<br><br>

  After completing their share of tasks, faculty mentors <p class="highlight-janus">can monitor the status of each hired student in real-time.</p> Potential roadblocks in the hiring process immediately come to surface in this transparent ecosystem.<br><br>

  <h5><strong>5. Host focus groups and feedback sessions</strong></h5>

      <img src="<%= image_path("images/project-janus/focus.jpeg") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="We held a user feedback session with participating faculty.">

  The more comprehensive the scope of interaction and design that we opened for feedback and testing, the more valuable and actionable the insights and responses we received. For each feedback session, we made sure the product‚Äôs surface area was large enough to elicit valuable discussion and critique/feedback.<br><br>

  We transitioned from showing stakeholders high-level screens and interactions to more personable, workflow-specific flows. In doing so, we gathered responses to design a more inclusive experience. Opening the product for testing at various stages of design also gave our stakeholders an idea of the project development schedule.<br><br>

  <h2><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2><br>

  1. Meet with faculty that showed more interest in sharing their feedback to present them with the changes made based on the feedback received from previous sessions.<br><br>

  2. Set one-on-one client discovery meetings with interested faculty members to discuss opportunities to integrate screening and  interviewing functions within Janus.<br><br>

  3. Synthesize insights from the focus groups and interviews to reinforce or break away from designs at hand.<br><br>
  <h2><strong>Some Things I Learned</strong></h2>

  <h5>1. It‚Äôs practical to build by component.</h5>
      In deciding to fully flesh out the designs for faculty before tackling the student and admin sides, I spent less time making aesthetic decisions by reusing the deliverable-level assets on the faculty end and focused on crafting the ideal user experience.<br><br>

  <h5>2. Anticipate interactions among all three ends.</h5>
  Keeping the color-coded workflow in mind, even while designing for just one end at a time, eased me into identifying features that empowered end-to-end data transmission and communication.<br><br>

  <h5>3. Seek out feedback by forming and leading brainstorm and feedback sessions.</h5>
  Feedback was the most powerful driver of direction‚Äìwhether it be backtracking to an earlier solution/decision or solidifying a user-approved design decision.<br><br>

  In feedback sessions with over 50 participants, my team and I reached out to a handful of Tandon faculty who have given us the most meaningful insights to have them test our designs frequently and consistently in focus groups.<br><br>

  <h5>4. There is always someone I can serve better.</h5>
  It pays to go out of my way to meet and get to know users and their habits, behaviors, conditions, and feelings‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin person. Building relationships with these people push me to continuously optimize features, UI components, and copy to accommodate as many people as possible‚Äì from tech geeks and busy bees to the non tech-savvy and color blind.<br><br><br>

<!--Lucky Cat-->
<h2><strong>Proof of Concept</strong></h2>

<img src="<%= image_path("images/project-lucky-cat/original.JPG") %>" class="zoomImages" alt="My original plan had too many moving parts">

<div class="condense">
  My original plan had three parts– a temperature sensor that serves as an analog input dictates the fan speed, the fan that responds to the current temperature, and a lucky cat that would wave whenever the fan is on. The interaction to be made over a WiFi connection was limited to changing the fan speed.<br><br>

  This defeats the purpose of having all these moving parts because logically, the an analog input would coincide with the input made through the supposed GUI on the browser.<br><br>

  <h5><strong>Scaling Back</strong></h5>
  I simplified my concept for it to be more straightforward and intuitive. I created a paw-waving, wish-granting cat! For my setup, the microcontroller (server) returns a physical response (the cat waving) upon the browser’s (client) request.

  <h5><em>Submit your wish through the form on the browser UI and the lucky cat will wave for each character in your wish to grant it.</em></h5>

  My initial protype, taking into consideration the physicality of the object.<br><br>

  <h5><strong>I/O</strong></h5>
  In terms of the interaction, the command “Make a wish!” would prompt the user to enter his/her wish. Upon clicking the “Wish it” button (which affords clicking/pressing), the prompt returns a feedback “Wishing for _______ 😻”.<br><br>

  In addition to this, the “bell” attached to the cat’s collar would light up while its right paw waves. Once the waving is done, the light goes out.<br><br>
